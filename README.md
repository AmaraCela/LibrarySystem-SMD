&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate and enhance a better access to the education system, an efficient solution is to digitalize the Universityâ€™s Library in order to bring it closer to all the students as well as to provide better management features to the managers and administrators of the library. Our work consists of taking all the necessary steps that will result in the creation and maintenance of the finished product, the library web application for Epoka University.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This web app will provide useful features for all students, including but not limited to viewing the available books, ordering them for pickup, personalizing their account by adding books to favorites, as well as giving feedback or requests. In order to register, students are only required to create an account using their Epoka email.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orders and feedback will be managed by the manager of the library, who will also be able to create an account using the Epoka email. A suitable graphical interface will be provided for this type of user.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supply of the books and their entry in the system will be an available feature for the administrator, who is also a user of the website. Administrators will also be able to access statistics of the books that are borrowed and which ones are requested the most in the library. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to best meet the needs of all the involved parties (stakeholders) an ongoing process of communication, design and implementation is established, the documentation of which will be provided in this repository.<br><br>
